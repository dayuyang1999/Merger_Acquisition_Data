    "- So, Which kind of node we should consider? (CONCLUSION: consider all gvkey that shown on either `tnic_top_k` and `df_ma`, and they must meet the requirement of financial variable)\n",
    "    - consider node that: did not appear in the network (not in tnic top_k), but involved in a MA event? \n",
    "        - this is not possible? or is possible?\n",
    "            - **Why a lot gvkey in ma will not be found in TNIC?**\n",

    "    - consider node that: never involved in a MA event, but appear in TNIC top_k ?  \n",

    "- in MA, you are not necessaily merge with your peers (in fact, above 50% of the MA is happening with the firms outside the top_10 peers). This is different with Dyrep.\n",
    "    - in Dyrep, all `communication` must happend with `linked nodes`. Otherwise, the `communication` will be ignored.\n",
    "        - that means the \"probability of event happens\" is a function of edge embeddiing connecting `u` and `v`\n",
    "    - in MA, `u` and `v` are not necessaily connected in the network.\n",
    "        - we get the \"probability of event happens\" as a function of node embedding of `u` and `v`.\n",
